# FruitFall
A game made for a "Game Jam" at UBC-O!! 

## Inspiration
We were intrigued by games focused on managing resources and wanted to blend that with fast-paced gameplay. Our game, FruitFalls, challenges players to not only react quickly but also make smart choices about managing their resources within the game.

## What it does
n FruitFalls, players enter a vibrant world where fruits and peppers fall from the sky. Players need quick reflexes and smart strategy to catch fruits while avoiding explosive peppers. Catching fruits increases earnings, but peppers cost players lives. Starting with just 10 lives, staying alert is key.

## How we built it
We created FruitFalls using Processing, taking advantage of its ability to use high-quality images and its support for creating realistic animations and graphics. Our development process involved constant testing and refining, making sure our game was both visually appealing and fun to play. Processing's tools helped us implement game logic effectively.

## Challenges we ran into
Developing FruitFalls brought challenges, especially in coding complex gameplay mechanics. Integrating different game systems smoothly was tough, leading to logic errors and bugs. These required detailed debugging and problem-solving.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of creating an engaging and visually appealing game. Our focus on vibrant graphics and smooth gameplay mechanics paid off, providing a fun experience that challenges players. We're especially proud of the positive feedback from players, which affirms our efforts in making a game that people enjoy.

## What we learned
The development process taught us the value of teamwork and leveraging diverse skills. An iterative approach to design helped us refine our game continuously based on testing and feedback. We learned the importance of adaptability, overcoming unforeseen challenges through persistence.

## What's next for FruitFalls
We plan to add new features to FruitFalls, like power-ups, bonus levels, and possibly multiplayer modes, to keep the game exciting and attract more players. We're eager to continue improving FruitFalls and exploring new ways to innovate and expand the game.
